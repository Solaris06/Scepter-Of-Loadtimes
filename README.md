# The Scepter Of Loadtimes
Sonic '06 Video-based Load-Adjuster for Livesplit

## Installation Instructions

The pre-setup instructions are in this readme: https://github.com/ROMaster2/LiveSplit.VideoAutoSplit

The latest release posted is the game profile, download before step 6 under "Installation".

RTA is kept as-is, any loadless results will be displayed and stored under game time, so runs using this are still submittable if they are worth uploading RTA (to you).

Adding a timer under your current RTA one that displays game time is a simple way to keep track of it live, recommended.

## Building/changing notes:

You can clone this repo and then when browsing for a profile, shift+click the "browse" button to load the *folder* instead of a consolidated .vas file.

Also, .vas files are renamed .zip files.
